c 1. Chris and Dolly were discussing about their monthly bills to be paid in the due time and identified 
that they are pending in paying the electrical bill and Dolly asks for the electrical bill details. Here 
are the details given by Chris for the payment of bill. Generate electricity bill based on numbers of units 
consumed

• if units are <50 then rate per unit is 2RS.
• Units are >= 51 and <= 100 then rate per unit is 3RS.
• units are>= 101 and <= 300 then rate per unit is 5 Rs and add extra 100Rs to the total bill.
• units are >=301 and <= 450 then rate per unit is 6RS and add extra 200 RS to the total bill
• units are >450 then per unit is 8RS and add extra 250 RS to the total bill.
Now your task is to identify the units utilized and the amount to be pay.


2. The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each 
number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, F (0) = 0, F (1) = 1 F(n) =
 F (n - 1) + F (n - 2), for n > 1. Given n, calculate F(n). Now your task to print the Fibonacci series number’s 
up to n number.


3. Given a number N, check if a number is perfect or not. A number is said to be perfect if sum of all its factors 
excluding the number itself is equal to the number. Now your task to check whether the given number is Perfect 
number or not
